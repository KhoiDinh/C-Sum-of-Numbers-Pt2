# C-Sum-of-Numbers-Pt2
Write a program that reads in ten whole numbers and that outputs the sum of all the numbers greater than zero, the sum of all the numbers less than or equal to zero (which will be a negative number or zero), and the sum of all numbers, whether positive, negative or zero. The user enters the ten numbers just once each and the user can enter them in any order. Your program should not ask the user to enter the positive and negative numbers separately. You MUST use a loop in this program.
